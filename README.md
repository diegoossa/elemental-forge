# Elemental Forge: The Mystic Energy Card Game

## Introduction

Welcome to Elemental Forge, a fast-paced and exciting card game that combines strategy and luck. In this game, players use their mystical energy and elemental cards to forge powerful combinations and become the ultimate elemental master.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to be the first player to score 10 points, by forging powerful combinations of elemental cards.

## Game Components

    60 Elemental cards (6 elements x 10 cards each)
    30 Mystic Energy cards
    30 Scroll cards (recipe to forge the elements)
    1 Rule book

## Set Up

    Shuffle the Elemental, Mystic Energy and Scroll decks separately.
    Deal 5 cards to each player from the Elemental deck.
    Place the remaining Elemental, Mystic Energy and Scroll decks face down on the playing area.
    The first player starts by drawing a card from the Elemental deck.

## Game Play

    On each turn, a player can choose to draw a card from any of the three decks (Elemental, Mystic Energy or Scroll), or forge a combination by using Mystic Energy and Scroll cards in combination with Elemental cards.
    To forge a combination, a player must have the required number of Mystic Energy and Scroll cards and the corresponding Elemental cards in their hand. The player reveals the cards and puts them in a discard pile. The player then scores points according to the forged combination (refer to the combination tree).
    A player can hold a maximum of 8 cards in their hand. If a player has more than 8 cards in their hand, they must discard down to 8 cards at the end of their turn.
    The game ends when a player has scored 10 points, or when the Elemental, Mystic Energy and Scroll decks run out of cards.
